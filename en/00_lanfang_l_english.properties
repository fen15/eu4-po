# Events
khmer.1.t코0=The Dark Age of Cambodia
khmer.1.d코0=The once mighty Khmer Empire has fallen. Angkor, the very heart of Khmer civilization, lies ruined and abandoned after being devastatingly sacked by Thai invaders. Across Cambodia temples and cities fall into decay as King [Root.Monarch.GetName] struggles to project [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rule beyond the new capital at [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. This is a dark time for the Khmer people.
khmer.1.a코0=We will rise again.
khmer_dark_age_tt코0=§YAll power costs§! are increased by §R25%§!
khmer.2.t코0=Khmer Resurgence
khmer.2.d코0=The years since the fall of Angkor have been trying, but through the tireless efforts of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] we have emerged from the darkness that beset [Root.GetName]. The great city of Angkor and its majestic temple-complex have been restored and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has restored it as the capital. The countryside is once again populated and productive, and the hearts of our people are spiritually fulfilled. The Khmer Empire is ready to rise again.
khmer.2.a코0=Victory for [Root.GetName]!
khmer.3.t코0=Faith in the [Root.GetName] [Root.GovernmentName]
khmer.3.d코0=Our conversion to Theravada Buddhism was not an entirely smooth transition. There are those who resisted the teachings of the Buddha and continue to practice Hinduism, while others believe that the Mahayana branch is the true path. Now that we have achieved some semblance of religious peace, we should decide on which faith we should adopt as the state religion.
khmer.3.a코0=Our Theravada faith will bring us to enlightenment.
khmer.3.b코0=Let us look to our past; we shall revert to Hinduism.

In these times of war and uncertainty the people look to Shin Sawbu, mother of King Binnya Waru, to guide them.

Proclaiming her as Queen Regent will surely be popular among the people.
flavor_peg.1.d2코0=With the male line of Pegu nearly depleted, the succession is insecure. In these times of war and uncertainty the people look to Shin Sawbu, mother of King Binnya Waru, to guide them.

Proclaiming her as heir to the Kingdom will surely be popular among the people.
flavor_peg.1.a코0=Shin Sawbu shall be our Queen.

flavor_peg.2.t코0=Dhammazedi
flavor_peg.2.d코2=During Shin Sawbu’s unhappy years at the court of Ava she met a Mon monk named Pitakahara.

Pitakahara’s loyalty to the future Queen was great, and they devised a plan to escape back to Pegu together. Pitakahara is now the Queen’s closest advisor. As Shin Sawbu grows older she wishes to retire and live a life of spiritual devotion. She openly contemplates marrying Pitakahara to one of her daughters, granting him the title of Dhammazedi, and proclaiming him King of Pegu.
flavor_peg.2.a코0=Let Dhammazedi take the throne right away.
flavor_peg.2.b코0=Name Dhammazedi heir to the throne.
flavor_peg.2.c코0=We will not be ruled by a monk.
flavor_suk.1.t코0=The Ascension of Trailok
flavor_suk.1.d코0=In recent years the once mighty Kingdom of Sukhothai has become no more than a viceroyalty of Ayutthaya. Seizing an opportunity to gain more control over Sukhothai, an Ayutthayan prince was appointed as King of Sukhothai following the death of their last sovereign king, Borommapan.

Despite the protestations of the monks tending the shrine, our soldiers seize the sacred icon and prepare it for the journey to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. There, it will be revered and protected by more worthy guardians.
flavor_lna.1.a코0=The [From.Owner.GetAdjective] were unworthy of even gazing upon it.
flavor_lna.2.t코0=Theft of the Emerald Buddha
flavor_lna.2.d코0=Disaster strikes as the gates of [emerald_buddha_province.GetName] fall, leaving the way open to the shrine of the Emerald Buddha.

flavor_lna.3.t코0=[Root.GetAdjective] Absolutism
flavor_lna.3.d코0=The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is far more than a mortal human. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] is a Chakravarti, a divine light that shines upon humanity, a great beacon that guides us towards harmony and enlightenment. The rule of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] must be felt across every corner of the world so that all may know peace and prosperity.
flavor_lna.3.a코0=We will bring order to the world.
flavor_lna.3.b코0=Our current government suits us well.
ming_crisis.10.t코0=Turmoil in China
ming_crisis.10.d코0=The Ming dynasty is in crisis. The state struggles to control even its own territory, with warlords raising armies and vying for power across China.

For the first time the archipelago is developing a kind of national consciousness, making us more than a glorified city-state with a throng of tributary subjects and into a single nation. This new development requires us to consider how we should name our emerging state.

siamese_rev.1.t코0=The Siamese Revolution
siamese_rev.1.d코1=As our ties with the Westerners grow, there are many within [Root.GetName] who view the foreigners with suspicion.

siamese_rev.1.a코0=This is a grave matter.
siamese_rev.2.t코0=End of the Siamese Revolution
siamese_rev.2.d코1=The dust has settled after Phetracha’s swift and well-executed coup. The Europeans have been driven out and seditious elements within the palace have been arrested and executed.

siamese_rev.5.d코1=Suspicious military activity has been observed among the token [sia_european_aggressor_country.GetAdjective] garrison forces that we have allowed to be garrisoned in our nation. There is some justified suspicion that these maneuvers indicate a coming invasion, a surprise attack to quickly seize the palace and install [sia_european_aggressor_country.GetAdjective] rule. It is also possible that these activities are benign.
siamese_rev.5.a코0=There is nothing we can do.
siamese_rev.5.b코1=Expel these forces immediately.

siamese_rev.8.t코0=Phetracha's Arrest

siamese_rev.9.d코2=The increasing presence of European traders, diplomats, and armies in East Asia is a matter of great concern to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Thus far relations between them and [Root.GetName] have been limited, and [narai_foreign_policy_country.GetName] ambassadors have assured us that they seek only to trade with and learn about our nation. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and his advisors have much to contemplate.

arrest_phetracha_tt코0=Phetracha will be arrested.
majapahit.1.t코0=A Hero Emerges
majapahit.1.d코1=The prime minister's nephew arrived at our court not long ago, everything about him was completely unknown but his name - Damarwulan. He served us as a stableboy, but soon the rumors of his natural beauty reached the prime minister's daughter and there are few fires harder to extinguish than young love.\nThe fate that awaits him for his affront should be clear as a summer day, however, our ruler [Root.Monarch.GetName] has woke up at night, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] face drenched in sweat, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes wider than suns: "I had a dream," [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] announces, "that a young man named Damarwulan saved our kingdom."
majapahit.1.a코0=Perhaps he is our savior.
majapahit.1.b코0=Banish him for his crime.

majapahit.2.t코0=Damarwulan's Victory
majapahit.2.d코1=It never gets any easier. Rotten blood still reeks as one's own, the enemies' eyes are still human eyes, the night before the battle still keeps Damarwulan wide awake.\nThe battle ends victoriously, like any other battle has before for him. This is the fifth battle, and he wishes five is the final number. When he returns to court, he is received with the greatest of honors, his name repeated so many times that he forgets it is his name and thinks it is just another word for "victory". [Root.Monarch.GetName] approaches him, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] heart filled with joy. "Young Damarwulan," [Root.Monarch.GetHeShe] says, "you are not that young anymore."
majapahit.2.a코0=He shall become our Consort.

majapahit.2.c코0=He shall be greatly honored.
majapahit.3.t코0=The Fall of Majapahit
majapahit.3.d코0=Majapahit is an empire in its death throes. Once the center of a vast network of vassal kingdoms and tributary states, Majapahit now has little power beyond [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. Chinese support for our rivals in Malacca as well as the rising power of Brunei have led to the collapse of our hegemony. Worse, internal struggles over the succession threaten to tear the remnants of the empire apart from the inside.
majapahit.3.a코0=These are dark times.
majapahit.4.t코0=A New Dawn for [Root.GetName]
majapahit.4.d코0=Against all odds, [Root.GetName] has emerged from decades of turmoil and decline as a newly resurgent power. A stable [Root.GovernmentName], loyal subjects, and a common faith bolster our resolve as we remember Gajah Mada’s oath: that one day Majapahit will rule all of Nusantara.
majapahit.4.a코0=We have returned from the brink.
majapahit.5.t코0=The Rise of Demak
majapahit.5.d코0=The increasingly autonomous Muslim community in Demak have found a champion in the renegade Majapahit prince [Root.demak_sultan.GetName].  [Root.demak_sultan.GetName] has not only declared the independence of the Demak Sultanate, but also seeks to seize the throne of Majapahit for himself. Bound by our many struggles, there is little that we can do while Demak gathers its strength.
majapahit.5.a코0=Traitors!
majapahit.6.t코0=The Rise of Mataram
majapahit.6.d코0=Majapahit has proven itself unable to govern even its holdings on Java.
